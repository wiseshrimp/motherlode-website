            Conventional sex education underrepresents the spectrum of sexual identity, and what is lacking often leads to misinformation from alternative sources.

          Pillow Talk is a computer-generated virtual reality experience that covers sex positive topics which are often omitted from traditional sex education curriculum. These topics include, but are not limited to, inclusivity within the vast sexual spectrum, communication in and out of the bedroom, and counteracting stigmas.
          <div className="s-text">
            Pillow Talk will act as an interactive platform that welcomes and celebrates the vast field of sexuality by including marginalized perspectives that have systematically been excluded from the conversation. This experience will be developed for the HTC Vive and Oculus Rift.
